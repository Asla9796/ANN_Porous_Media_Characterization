## Characterization of porous media using Artificial Neural Networks
- Artificial neural network with 1 input layer with 2 inputs each, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer
- Predicts 2D porosity distribution from the input 2D flow-field data
- Novel method of characterization of porous media such as human tissues, where sampling and measurement techniques are restricted
- Technique avoids usage of destructive probes to collect data from human body; modeling can be done from flow data readily measurable via non contact methods such as ultrasonic dopplemetry
- Applications in enhancing surgical control and precision medicine
- Read more on the technique [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gY0cw4vwHb5vDOUYNPWR2VQB47ACThm9tQfIzElzE8U/edit?usp=sharing)
- Code written in C++
- Please note: network and code is yet to be optimized
